### 3. Manual Balance Adjustment (HR/Admin Only)
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/employees/:id/leave-balance`

- **Purpose**: Fine-tune individual leave balances (grant bonus leaves, adjust carried forward, compensate for errors)
- **Fields Editable**:
  - Total Days
  - Used Days
  - Carried Forward Days
  - Available Days (auto-calculated)

### 4. Employee Detail Page
- **Route**: `/employees/:id`
