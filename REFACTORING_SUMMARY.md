# Refactoring Summary - Staffly HRMS Frontend

## Date: October 16, 2025

### Overview
Major refactoring completed to consolidate architecture, fix Redux state management, and remove unused code.

---

## 1. Architecture Consolidation ✅

### Problem
- **Dual API/Services architecture** caused confusion
- Services were just wrappers calling API functions
- 3-layer architecture (API → Services → Hooks) was redundant

### Solution
- **Consolidated to 2-layer architecture** (Services → Hooks)
- Moved all axios calls directly into service files
- Removed entire `client/src/API` folder
- Each service now handles:
  - Direct axios calls
  - Error handling
  - Data processing
  - Response transformation

### Files Refactored
1. **authService.js** - 11 functions (login, register, googleLogin, logout, getCurrentUser, updateProfile, changePassword, deleteAccount, getUserForLeaderboard, isAuthenticated, getStoredUser)
2. **employeeService.js** - 13 functions (CRUD, departments, stats, profile picture upload, CSV export)
3. **attendanceService.js** - 9 functions (check-in/out, records, reports, stats)
4. **leaveService.js** - 11 functions (apply, approve, reject, cancel, balance, statistics)
5. **policyService.js** - 12 functions (CRUD for policies, leave types, activation)
6. **analyticsService.js** - 5 functions (time spent, peak hours, dashboard analytics)

---

## 2. Redux State Management Fix ✅

### Problem
- `useAuth` hook was **NOT dispatching Redux actions**
- Login/logout/profile updates were only updating localStorage
- Global state was out of sync with actual auth state
- Components couldn't access user data from Redux reliably

### Solution Implemented

#### Updated `useAuth.js` Hook
```javascript
// Before: No Redux dispatch
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const response = await authService.login({ email, password });
  return response; // ❌ No state update
};

// After: Dispatch Redux action
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const response = await authService.login({ email, password });
  dispatch(loginAction({
    user: response.user,
    token: response.token,
  })); // ✅ Updates global state
  return response;
};
```

#### All Auth Operations Now Dispatch:
- ✅ **login** → dispatches `loginAction()`
- ✅ **register** → dispatches `loginAction()` (if auto-login after signup)
- ✅ **loginWithGoogle** → dispatches `loginAction()`
- ✅ **logout** → dispatches `logoutAction()`
- ✅ **updateProfile** → dispatches `updateUserProfile()`
- ✅ **getCurrentUser** → dispatches `updateUserProfile()`
- ✅ **deleteAccount** → dispatches `logoutAction()`

#### Updated `authSlice.js`
```javascript
login: (state, action) => {
  state.isAuthenticated = true;
  state.user = action.payload.user;
  state.token = action.payload.token;
  // Keep localStorage in sync
  localStorage.setItem('authToken', action.payload.token);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(action.payload.user));
},

updateUserProfile: (state, action) => {
  // Supports both full user object and partial profile updates
  if (action.payload.email) {
    state.user = { ...state.user, ...action.payload };
  } else {
    state.user = {
      ...state.user,
      profile: { ...state.user?.profile, ...action.payload },
    };
  }
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(state.user));
}
```

#### Fixed Route Guards
- **ProtectedRoute.jsx** - Now uses `state.auth.isAuthenticated` instead of `state.auth.authToken`
- **PublicRoute.jsx** - Already using Redux correctly ✅
- **RoleBasedRoute.jsx** - Already using Redux correctly ✅

---

## 3. Export/Import Fixes ✅

### Problem
- `useAuth.js` had both default and named exports
- Pages were importing `{ useAuth }` but file exported `export default useAuth`

### Solution
- Removed `export default useAuth`
- Kept only `export const useAuth = () => { ... }`
- All imports now work correctly: `import { useAuth } from '../../Hooks/useAuth'`

---

## 4. Code Cleanup ✅

### Deleted Files
- ❌ `client/src/API/` folder (entire directory with 7 files)
- ❌ `client/src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx` (old version)
- ❌ `client/src/pages/Auth/Signup.jsx` (old version)
- ❌ `client/src/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx` (duplicate)

### Removed Unused Imports
- Removed unused imports from `AppRouter.jsx`
- Removed `eventParticapted` action from authSlice (not used in HRMS)

---

## 5. Route Protection ✅

### Login/Signup Pages
- **Already wrapped with PublicRoute** ✅
- Authenticated users are redirected to `/dashboard`
- Prevents access to login page when already logged in

### Protected Routes
- All dashboard routes require authentication
- Role-based routes check user permissions
- Proper redirect flow implemented

---

## 6. Architecture Summary

### Before
```
Component
    ↓
useAuth Hook
    ↓
authService (wrapper)
    ↓
authAPI (axios calls)
    ↓
Backend API
```

### After
```
Component
    ↓
useAuth Hook (with Redux dispatch)
    ↓  ↘
    ↓   Redux Store (global state)
    ↓
authService (direct axios calls)
    ↓
Backend API
```

---

## 7. State Flow (Current Implementation)

### Login Flow
1. User enters credentials in `LoginPage.jsx`
2. Calls `login()` from `useAuth` hook
3. `authService.login()` makes API call
4. Response received with user + token
5. **Redux action dispatched** → `loginAction({ user, token })`
6. Global state updated + localStorage synced
7. Navigation to `/dashboard`
8. All components can access user via `useSelector(state => state.auth.user)`

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout
2. Calls `logout()` from `useAuth` hook
3. `authService.logout()` makes API call
4. **Redux action dispatched** → `logoutAction()`
5. Global state cleared + localStorage cleared
6. Redirect to `/login`

### Profile Update Flow
1. User updates profile in `ProfilePage.jsx`
2. Calls `updateProfile(data)` from `useAuth` hook
3. `authService.updateProfile()` makes API call
4. **Redux action dispatched** → `updateUserProfile(user)`
5. Global state updated with new user data
6. All components re-render with fresh user data

---

## 8. Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Cleaner Architecture
- Single responsibility principle
- No redundant wrapper layers
- Direct service → API communication

### ✅ Proper State Management
- Redux is now the single source of truth
- localStorage kept as backup/persistence
- All components can access auth state reliably

### ✅ Better Developer Experience
- Clear separation: Hooks → Services → API
- Easy to understand data flow
- Consistent patterns across all features

### ✅ Reduced Code Duplication
- Removed ~500+ lines of redundant wrapper code
- Services contain both logic and API calls
- No need to update two places for one change

### ✅ Type Safety & Maintainability
- Clearer function signatures
- Better error handling
- Easier to test and debug

## 9. Testing Checklist

### Auth Flow
- [ ] Login with email/password
- [ ] Register new user
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Access protected routes while logged out (should redirect)
- [ ] Access login page while logged in (should redirect)
- [ ] Update profile
- [ ] Change password

### Redux State
- [ ] User data persists after page reload
- [ ] Token stored in Redux and localStorage
- [ ] Profile updates reflect across all components
- [ ] Logout clears all state

### Route Guards
- [ ] ProtectedRoute blocks unauthenticated users
- [ ] PublicRoute redirects authenticated users
- [ ] RoleBasedRoute checks permissions correctly

---

## 10. Next Steps (Recommendations)

### High Priority
1. **Add loading states** - Show spinners during API calls
2. **Error boundaries** - Catch and display errors gracefully
3. **Token refresh** - Implement automatic token refresh
4. **Persist Redux** - Consider redux-persist for better state management

### Medium Priority
1. **API response interceptors** - Handle 401/403 globally
2. **Optimistic updates** - Update UI before API response
3. **Caching** - Cache frequently accessed data

### Low Priority
1. **TypeScript migration** - Add type safety
2. **Unit tests** - Test services and hooks
3. **E2E tests** - Test complete user flows
