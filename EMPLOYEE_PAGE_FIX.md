# Employee List Page Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Wrong Hook Imports**
- **Problem**: Page was importing a non-existent combined `useEmployee` hook
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed to `useEmployees` for data fetching
  - Changed to `useEmployeeActions` for CRUD operations
  - Hooks now properly separated by responsibility

### 2. **No Role-Based Access Control**
- **Problem**: Any authenticated user could access employee management page
- **Solution**:
  - Added Redux `useSelector` to get current user
  - Added role check: `user?.role === 'admin' || user?.employeeRole === 'hr' || user?.employeeRole === 'admin'`
  - Added redirect to `/access-denied` for non-HR/Admin users
  - Page now properly restricted to HR and Admin roles only

### 3. **Field Mismatch (position vs designation)**
- **Problem**: Form used `position` field but Employee model has `designation`
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all form fields from `position` to `designation`
  - Updated table column from `position` to `designation`
  - Updated card view display from `position` to `designation`
  - Updated initial form state to use `designation`

### 4. **CRUD Handler Functions**
- **Problem**: Handlers were calling non-existent methods
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `handleAddEmployee` to use `addEmployeeAction` from `useEmployeeActions`
  - Updated `handleEditEmployee` to use `updateEmployeeAction` from `useEmployeeActions`
  - Updated `handleDeleteEmployee` to use `deleteEmployeeAction` from `useEmployeeActions`
  - Removed `loadEmployees()` calls, now using `fetchAllEmployees()` refetch function
  - Added proper error handling with detailed error messages

## Changes Made

### File: `client/src/pages/Employee/EmployeeListPage.jsx`

#### 1. Imports Updated
```javascript
// BEFORE
import { useEmployee } from '../../Hooks/useEmployee';

// AFTER
import { useEmployees, useEmployeeActions } from '../../Hooks/useEmployee';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

#### 2. Role-Based Access Control Added
```javascript
const user = useSelector((state) => state.auth.user);
const isHROrAdmin = user?.role === 'admin' || 
                    user?.employeeRole === 'hr' || 
                    user?.employeeRole === 'admin';

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isHROrAdmin) {
    navigate('/access-denied');
  }
}, [isHROrAdmin, navigate]);
```

#### 3. Hooks Split
```javascript
// BEFORE
const { employees, loading, addEmployee, updateEmployee, deleteEmployee, fetchAllEmployees } = useEmployee();

// AFTER
const { employees, loading, fetchAllEmployees } = useEmployees({ autoFetch: true });
const { addEmployee: addEmployeeAction, updateEmployee: updateEmployeeAction, deleteEmployee: deleteEmployeeAction } = useEmployeeActions();
```

#### 4. Form State Updated
```javascript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: '',
  email: '',
  phone: '',
  department: '',
  designation: '',  // Changed from 'position'
  salary: '',
  joiningDate: '',
  address: '',
  role: 'employee'  // Added default role
});
```

#### 5. Handler Functions Updated
```javascript
// Add Employee
const handleAddEmployee = async () => {
  try {
    await addEmployeeAction(formData);
    showSuccess('Employee added successfully!');
    setIsAddModalOpen(false);
    resetForm();
    fetchAllEmployees();
  } catch (error) {
    showError(error?.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to add employee');
    console.error('Add employee error:', error);
  }
};

// Edit Employee
const handleEditEmployee = async () => {
  try {
    await updateEmployeeAction(selectedEmployee._id, formData);
    showSuccess('Employee updated successfully!');
    setIsEditModalOpen(false);
    resetForm();
    fetchAllEmployees();
  } catch (error) {
    showError(error?.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to update employee');
    console.error('Update employee error:', error);
  }
};

// Delete Employee
const handleDeleteEmployee = async (id) => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to terminate this employee?')) {
    try {
      await deleteEmployeeAction(id);
      showSuccess('Employee terminated successfully!');
      fetchAllEmployees();
    } catch (error) {
      showError(error?.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to delete employee');
      console.error('Delete employee error:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

#### 6. Table Column Updated
```javascript
{ key: 'designation', label: 'Designation', sortable: true }  // Was 'position'
```

#### 7. Form Inputs Updated
```html
<!-- Add & Edit Modal Forms -->
<Input
  label="Designation"
  placeholder="Software Engineer"
  value={formData.designation}
  onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, designation: e.target.value })}
/>
```

## Backend Authorization (Already in Place)

### Employee Routes Protection
```javascript
// server/route/employeeRoutes.js
router.get('/', protect, hrOnly, getEmployees);           // HR/Admin only
router.post('/', protect, hrOnly, addEmployee);           // HR/Admin only
router.get('/:id', protect, hrOnly, getEmployeeById);     // HR/Admin only
router.put('/:id', protect, hrOnly, updateEmployee);      // HR/Admin only
router.delete('/:id', protect, hrOnly, deleteEmployee);   // HR/Admin only

// Personal profile routes (all authenticated users)
router.get('/me', protect, getMyProfile);
router.put('/me', protect, updateMyProfile);
```

### Middleware Checks
- `protect`: Loads both User and Employee data, attaches to `req.user`
- `hrOnly`: Checks `req.user.role === 'admin'` OR `req.user.employeeRole === 'hr'` OR `req.user.employeeRole === 'admin'`

## Expected Behavior

### For Regular Employees
1. Cannot access `/employees` page
2. Redirected to `/access-denied` if they try
3. Can only access their own profile via `/employees/me`

### For HR/Admin Users
1. Can access employee list page
2. Can view all employees in table or grid view
3. Can add new employees with all required fields
4. Can edit existing employee details
5. Can terminate/delete employees
6. All CRUD operations work with proper error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Fetch Employees**: 
   - `useEmployees({ autoFetch: true })` → GET `/api/employees`
   - Response: `{ success: true, data: { employees: [...], pagination: {...} } }`
   - Hook extracts: `response.employees || response || []`

2. **Add Employee**:
   - `addEmployeeAction(formData)` → POST `/api/employees`
   - Creates: Employee, User, and Profile records
   - Returns: New employee object

3. **Update Employee**:
   - `updateEmployeeAction(id, formData)` → PUT `/api/employees/:id`
   - Updates: Employee record
   - Returns: Updated employee object

4. **Delete Employee**:
   - `deleteEmployeeAction(id)` → DELETE `/api/employees/:id`
   - Soft delete: Sets status to 'terminated'
   - Returns: Success message
